# JaDom

## A comprehensive Java dom interaction library

JaDom is a java project which allows the creation and manipulation of HTML form the java source. 

The goal of JaDom is to provide an advanced robust library which helps developers to easily interact between frontend html code and server side java.  JaDom will allow the server to quickly manipulate the front end, building dynamic pages and articles based of bussiness logic. JaDom also will allow to servre to get detailed information about how the user is using the window and the document object. This includes information on current pointer loccations, resize events, focus and much more.

JaDom is currently under heavy development as we prepare for the alpha release at the end of the year. Feel free to use the project and the code just be aware that development is quite heavy.

Here is some of the features currently  in works

 - capability to add java server side event listeners for <b>all</b> dom events
 - capability to add java server side event listeners for some window events
 - capability to trigger java and dom events from the server
 - capability to trigger build dynamic java functions from the server
 - quick integration of bootstrap with automaically populated class names for manny of the common components
 - code builders to quicky produce dynamic navigation
 - Maven JaDom template for easy depolyment and quicker development
